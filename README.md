Our project is about making a web application which enables users to register themselves to find and book vaccination slots near them and stores details of all the users which get vaccinated. This application will be mainly intended for people whose resides in India. 

A person can register/login their details to the portal and a date for vaccination will be scheduled as per the userâ€™s desire. A user can choose a date/reschedule and/or cancel the appointment. Once a vaccination is obtained from a center, it will be reflected in the database and a follow-up for the second vaccination will be automatically registered. A user should also be able to choose their preferred vaccination i.e., Covishield, Covaxin, Sputnik, etc.  

There will also be an admin portal, where the admin can update (add/change/remove) parameters such as type-wise vaccine stock in a city/center. These admin portals will be available once for every center (For e.g., Mumbai admin would have different login credentials and should not be able to view other locations). 

The objective and motivation for this project is to improve user experience and ease of access by comparing to similar vaccine booking applications such as cowin.gov.in on parameters such as slot finding, user login/registration, vaccine selection options.
